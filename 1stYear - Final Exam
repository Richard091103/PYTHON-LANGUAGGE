#Program Description
  # Our program is composed of three main syntax such as Loops, Conditional Statements , 
  # and functions, from here we are able to create a game which is a "Quiz Game" in this program users would 
  # have the chance to answer the maximum question of five questions.If the players answer is correct it would display 
  # "Correct" and you got +1 to your score otherwise it would dislay "Wrong". After the users answer, their total score would be displayed and the program 
  # will prompt a question if the palayer wants to answer again but this time the set of questions would not be the same as the 
  # first one, it would be randomized based on the questions we provided.
